# Exception Handling Fix

## Problem Description

The global exception handlers in `app/main.py` were not showing proper error messages from the `/register` API. When a user tried to register with an existing email, the error message "User with this email already exists" was being lost and replaced with an empty string in the response.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the exception handling flow in the auth API endpoints (`app/api/auth.py`):

1. **Original Flow (Broken)**:
   ```
   HTTPException("User with this email already exists") 
   → caught by general except Exception as e: 
   → converted to new HTTPException with detail=str(e) 
   → str(e) on HTTPException returns empty string 
   → Global handler receives HTTPException with empty detail
   ```

2. **The Problem**:
   - When `HTTPException` instances were caught by the general `except Exception as e:` block
   - They were being converted to new `HTTPException` instances with `detail=str(e)`
   - `str(e)` on an `HTTPException` object returns an empty string
   - This caused the original error message to be lost

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Exception Handling in Auth API

Updated all endpoints in `app/api/auth.py` to handle `HTTPException` separately:

```python
try:
    # ... endpoint logic ...
except HTTPException:
    # Re-raise HTTPException as-is to preserve the original error details
    raise
except Exception as e:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
        detail=str(e)
    )
```

**Endpoints Fixed**:
- `/register` - User registration
- `/login` - User login with form data
- `/login-json` - User login with JSON data  
- `/me` - Get current user info

### 2. Enhanced Global Exception Handlers

Improved the global exception handlers in `app/main.py`:

```python
@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):
    """Global exception handler for HTTPExceptions"""
    logger.info(f"HTTPException: {exc.status_code} - {exc.detail}")
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={"detail": exc.detail}
    )
```

**Improvements**:
- Added logging for HTTPExceptions
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces for unhandled exceptions

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Test registration with existing email**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"email":"existing@example.com","password":"test123","full_name":"Test User"}'
   ```

3. **Expected Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "User with this email already exists"
   }
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/auth.py` - Fixed exception handling in all auth endpoints
2. `app/main.py` - Enhanced global exception handlers with better logging

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Exception Hierarchy**: Handle specific exceptions (`HTTPException`) before general ones (`Exception`)
2. **Preserve Original Errors**: Re-raise `HTTPException` instances without modification
3. **Proper Logging**: Add appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Consistent Error Format**: Maintain consistent error response format across all endpoints

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Original error messages are preserved
- ✅ HTTP status codes are maintained
- ✅ Global exception handlers work correctly
- ✅ Proper logging is in place for debugging
- ✅ All auth endpoints handle exceptions consistently
