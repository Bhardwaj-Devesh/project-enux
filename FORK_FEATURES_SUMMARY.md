## Key Features

1. **Fork Notifications**: When someone forks your playbook, you get notified
2. **Fork Count**: Each playbook shows how many times it's been forked
3. **Forked Indicator**: Forked playbooks are marked with "forked" status
4. **Combined View**: See both owned and forked playbooks in one place
5. **Detailed Fork Info**: See who forked your playbooks and when

## Frontend Usage

```javascript
// Get combined playbooks (owned + forked)
const playbooks = await fetch('/api/v1/playbooks/my-playbooks-combined');

// Get notifications
const notifications = await fetch('/api/v1/playbooks/notifications');

// Get notification count for badge
const { count } = await fetch('/api/v1/playbooks/notifications/count');

// Get detailed playbook with fork info
const playbook = await fetch(`/api/v1/playbooks/${id}/detailed`);
```
